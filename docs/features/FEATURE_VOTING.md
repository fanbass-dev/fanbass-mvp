# Feature Voting

## Overview
Feature Voting is a collaborative decision-making system that allows fans to influence the platform's development direction. It creates a direct feedback loop between users and the development team, ensuring that new features align with community needs and preferences.

## User Stories

### Fan Perspective
- As a fan, I want to suggest new features for the platform
- As a fan, I want to vote on which features should be prioritized
- As a fan, I want to track the status of features I've voted for
- As a fan, I want to discuss potential features with other users

### Industry Perspective
- As a promoter, I want to suggest industry-specific features
- As an artist, I want to request tools that help connect with fans
- As a platform admin, I want to understand user priorities

## Implementation

```typescript
type FeatureStatus =
  | 'proposed'

  const [userVotes, setUserVotes] = useState<Record<string, 'upvote' | 'downvote'>>({})

  // Operations
  const submitFeature = async (feature: Omit<Feature, 'id' | 'created_at' | 'updated_at'>) => {...}
  const castVote = async (featureId: string, voteType: 'upvote' | 'downvote') => {...}
  const addComment = async (featureId: string, content: string) => {...}

  return {
    features,
    userVotes,
    submitFeature,
    castVote,
    addComment
  }
}
```

### Database Tables

     updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now())
   );
   ```

2. **feature_votes**
   ```sql
   create table feature_votes (
     user_id uuid references auth.users,
     feature_id uuid references features,

     primary key (user_id, feature_id)
   );
   ```

3. **feature_comments**
